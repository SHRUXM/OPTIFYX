# Optifyx

This repository contains two Python scripts for basic security-related tasks:

* caesar_cipher.py: Implements the Caesar cipher, a simple substitution cipher that shifts letters by a fixed key.  It allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages.
* password_strength_checker.py:  Evaluates the strength of a password by checking for minimum length, lowercase/uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.

## Usage

1.  Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
2.  Clone this repository or download the Python files.
3.  Run the scripts from the command line:

    * *Caesar Cipher:*
        bash
        python caesar_cipher.py
        
        The script will prompt you for input (encrypt/decrypt choice, message, key).
    * *Password Strength Checker:*
        bash
        python password_strength_checker.py
        
        The script will ask you to enter a password to be checked.

## Project Details

* *Caesar Cipher:* This script demonstrates a fundamental encryption technique. While not secure for real-world applications, it's a good example for learning about cryptography concepts.
* *Password Strength Checker:* This script helps users understand common password security requirements.  It encourages the creation of stronger passwords by identifyingÂ weaknesses.
